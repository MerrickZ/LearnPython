# Calculate CRC32 for all files in current directory

## How to use ?

Just run this script. Double-click ```CRC32.py``` is OK.

## Output ?

This script will generate a ```crc32.txt``` besides it, which lists all CRC32 values of files in this directory.

## Why not md5 ?

CRC32 is just enough for me for now, and it's very fast.
